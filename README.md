🚀 Contact Management System (C++ | Doubly Linked List | File Backend | Security Integrated)

🔹 Project Overview

Developed a fully functional Contact Management System using C++ with advanced features like encryption, pagination, sorting, duplicate prevention, undo delete, and file-based backend storage.

✅ Core Features


📌 Data Structure Implementation

Implemented using Doubly Linked List

Efficient forward and backward traversal

Dynamic memory management

Safe node linking and unlinking



📌 CRUD Operations

Add Contact

Update Contact

Delete Contact (with Undo feature)

Search Contact (case-insensitive)

Show Contacts



📌 Advanced Search

Case-insensitive search logic

Optimized comparison handling

Accurate duplicate detection



📌 Duplicate Prevention

Prevents duplicate phone numbers

Prevents duplicate email addresses

Case-insensitive email comparison



📌 Validation System

Phone number validation (10 digits check)

Email format validation (@gmail, @yahoo, @outlook, etc.)

Country code validation (+91, +1, +44, +61)

Robust input validation to prevent crashes



📌 Data Security (Encryption Integrated)

Encrypted phone numbers before saving to file

Encrypted email addresses before saving

Automatic decryption while loading

File-level privacy protection



📌 File-Based Backend

Persistent storage using contacts.txt

Auto-save on update/add/delete

Auto-load on system startup

Export / download functionality



📌 Undo Delete Feature

Temporary storage of deleted contact

Allows user to restore before permanent deletion

Prevents accidental data loss



📌 Sorting System

Sort by Name (case-insensitive)

Sort by Phone Number

Sort by Email

Non-destructive sorting (original list preserved)



📌 Pagination (Scalable UI)

Displays 20 contacts per page

Next / Previous navigation

Handles large datasets efficiently

Prevents overwhelming output



📌 Edge Case Handling

Handles empty list safely

Handles invalid menu input

Handles non-numeric input

Prevents segmentation faults

Memory-safe pointer operations
